      <div class= "animated bounceInRight"><p class="card-text"> Streamline Blog is very similar to a website. I would say that blog is a diary/journal that is (mostly) maintained by one person – blogger. Usually, blogs are being updated quite often (once a day, once a week, once a month). Blogs can be private, but most of them are available on the internet for others to see.

            Blogs have certain topics. My blog's topic is “blogging” and “how to start one” – I'm helping beginners to start a blog, get more visitors and much more… BUT, it can also have several other topics. Bloggers are usually passionate about a specific topic thus they'll create one.
            
            Blog posts are the fundamental of a blog. Every blog on the internet consists of different blog posts written by the blogger. Blog posts can contain content (obviously!), videos, images, bullet-points, different headings and so on.
            
            Blogs (and blog posts) can be shared on social networks (Twitter, FaceBook, Google+) and people can leave comments under the blog posts in order to start meaningful conversations.
            
            Blogs can have a LOT of visitors. When your blog has enough posts and it starts to become popular, you'll start receiving traffic from other sites, social networks and even from search engines..</p>
